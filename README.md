# Web-Design-Challenge
Repository for HW 11 - Web Design!

<!-- index.html -->
This project starts at the index.html page which only serves to route you to the landingpage.html page. 

<!-- landingpage.html -->
This is the true homepage for the project, starting with some css styling and overall page bootstrap code.
The top of the page has a bootstrap nav bar that sports the current page name on the left and the other page links on the right.
There is a home page, four visualization pages, a data page, and a comparison page.
This navbar also will darken the link for the current page on the right.

Into the body of the page, we show a summary of the project on the left and the list panel of visualization on the right.

<!-- Vis 1 - 4 -->
This page show the deeper details of the current Vis. It has the main graph's comparison to latitude (Max Temp) as well a paragraph explaining the graph. 
It also has the same panel of graphs on the right, but also has a box around the current one.

<!-- Data -->
This page has the complete table of data used to for the graphs.
This data was originally in a CSV and was converted to HTML with the "csv_to_html" jupyter notebook in the project file.
The original and output files were renamed to show appropriately.

<!-- Comparison -->
This page show all four of the visualizations together, able to be clicked on.
The images are laid out in a table that will show two next to one another on medium to large screens.
It will shrink to one per row on smaller screens.

<!-- End -->
And that's about it! Thanks for checking out my project.
